Package: omake
Description-md5: e58aca17ee05cbcfe560fcf1443da512
Description-en: build system with automated dependency analysis
 OMake is a build system designed to scale from small projects to very
 large projects spanning many directories. OMake uses a syntax similar
 to GNU make, with many additional features.  It contains
 specifications for easily building C, OCaml, and LaTeX programs, but
 can be used to build projects with other languages as well.
 .
 OMake includes an accurate, automated dependency analysis based on
 MD5 digests.  It also includes a stand-alone command-line
 interpreter, osh, that can be used as an interactive shell for
 debugging the build files.  OMake's syntax is a full object oriented
 language.  Features of the OMake language include integer and
 floating point arithmetic, scoped expressions, higher order
 functions, multiple inheritance, pattern matching, runtime
 exceptions, lexers, and LALR(1) parsers.  Users can easily produce
 architecture independent builds as omake provides a uniform interface
 to its standard library on Linux/Unix, Win32, and OS X.

Package: omega-rpg
Description-md5: 0a1fef2d8d768400c503934ef049e045
Description-en: A text-based roguelike game
 Omega is a complex rogue-style game of dungeon exploration. Unlike other such
 games, there are a number of ways to "win", depending on various actions
 taken during play. The ways you can get your name on the high score board
 include becoming the highest ranked head of a guild, sect, college, etc., as
 well as gaining the most points figured from possessions and experience. The
 game (via the oracle) may impose some structure on your exploration, but you
 need not follow all of the oracle's advice. There *is* a "total winner"
 status, by the way.

    apply a filter to display search results in the editor
  - ability to batch process documents from the command line
  - extended project statistics
  - easy-to-understand documentation and tutorial
  - plugin architecture with separate Lucene stemmer
    (recognition of inflected forms) and LanguageTool (style
